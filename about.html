          <p>
            This project pairs musical creations by Henrik Lafrenz with visual creations by friendly artists. One song is paired with one work of art. At the outset of the project, which was in 2015, there were eight pairs. Now in 2018, eight new pairs have been added.
          </p>

          <h3>Usage instructions</h3>
          <p>
            Pick a random pair. You can see the artwork in a preview. You can also see how long the track is. If you are ready for the full-blown experience, click the little audio player at the bottom of the page. The music will start. Click on the artwork to get a bigger version. Now you can focus on something for a few minutes - on the internet! Listen to the music and look at the artwork. Think about what the artists are trying to tell you. Think about the meaning of life.
