	  <h2>What's all this?</h2>
          <p>
            This project pairs musical creations by Henrik Lafrenz with visual creations by friendly artists. One song is paired with one work of art. At the outset of the project there are eight pairs, but the collection is meant to grow over time. The artists were given very few parameters to work with - which for the most part got happily ignored!
          </p>

          <h2>Usage instructions</h2>
          <p>
            Pick a random pair. You can see the artwork in a preview. You can also see how long the track is. If you are ready for the full-blown experience, click the little audio player at the bottom of the page. The music will start. Click on the artwork to get a bigger version. Now you can focus on something for a few minutes - on the internet! Listen to the music and look at the artwork. Think about what the artists are trying to tell you. Think about the meaning of life.
          </p>

          <h2>What else is there?</h2>
          <p>
            If you want to listen to all Hip Honk tracks in a row, or even download them, you can do so <a href="http://urbanature.bandcamp.com/album/hip-honk-visual-artists" target="_blank"><b>on Urbanature's bandcamp page</b></a>. Please also check out the other music there. You can listen to more music by Henrik Lafrenz <a href="http://soundcloud.com/lost-horse" target="_blank"><b>on Soundlcoud</b></a>. Some of the visual artists also present themselves in the world wide web - if so, the name of the artist on their artist page here is a link to their website.

          <h2>Technical stuff</h2>
          <p>
            This website makes use of the libraries <a href="http://dev7studios.com/products/nivo-lightbox-wordpress-plugin/" target="_blank"><b>Nivo lightbox</b></a> and <a href="http://retina-images.complexcompulsions.com/" target="_blank"><b>Retina Images</b></a> - thank you! You can browse the source code of hiphonkandvisualartists.com <a href="https://github.com/henrik-lafrenz/hiphonkandvisualartists.com" target="_blank"><b>on Github</b></a> - but it's not particularly interesting.
